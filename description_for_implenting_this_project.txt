i have used Entity Framework for this mvc project and connected it with sql server for database connectivity, for that click model and add new item and click Data=>ADO.NET Entity Data Model ,
and then give it name as DBModels,

click Add,
click EF Designer from data... and the press Next,
then click new connection and select sql server(which ever version you have),
and the give server name (in my case it was .),

after giving server name you have a list of data bases (in my case it was "MvcCRUDDB"),
then click ok,
now a window appears with default file name as "MvcCRUDDBEntities", replace it with "DBModel1",
and click next....
woah! the connection has been established....





NOTE:you can check all the column and table names in the corresponsing classes
IMPORTANT NOTE: for preventing from error you have to make empid column as primary key in sql server......
